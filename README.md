* Scroll to bottom of page

* Scroll to section 5

* Select "Death" under event category

Remmeber to keep this in mind though, VAERS reportedly only gets [under 1%](https://digital.ahrq.gov/sites/default/files/docs/publication/r18hs017045-lazarus-final-report-2011.pdf) or between [1-10%](https://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/childrens-health/vaccinations-parents-informed-choice/) of all vaccine adverse events reported to them. This is easily explainable by the fact that most people don't know how to report adverse reactions of any kind including death. While death is more likely to be reported we should still take into consideration that the numbers could be deflated.
